       <b>avg Ain't Vector Graphics</b>
       <p>
       Multimedia on linux has made great progress. A few years ago, video support was very limited, low-latency-audio was impossible and getting jitter-free performance was a nightmare. This has changed, and all that's really missing is some glue that joins the different libraries. libavg is an effort to do for multimedia installations what the Gimp did for image editing, what OpenOffice did for word processing... and what Linux did for operating systems in general: give people an alternative that's free (as in speech, not beer). 
       <p>
       Presumably, companies will be using avg too, but the main effort will be to support artists and designers that don't have the resources to buy commercial software. Of course, that means that the system needs to run well on old computers, while allowing the use of all features on modern pcs. 
       <p>
       It should be almost as easy to build installations as it is to build a web page. Designing interactive systems will still need some programming skills, but this should be kept to a minimum. A avg installation consists of one or more xml files that describe screen layout(s) and corresponding python scripts that describe the dynamics of the installation: What to do when a user interacts with the system, some time has elapsed or any other input has arrived. The result is that the xml files are as easy to edit as html is - and many of the methods used for the interactive parts should be very familiar to anyone who's used javascript on a web page.
       <p><b>Status Quo</b>
       <p>
       Currently, libavg is stable and has the major features nessesary to build small and medium-sized multimedia presentations. It supports images (in 15 formats), videos (every file format that ffmpeg supports, and that's a lot), firewire cameras and scalable fonts with layout. Transparency and alpha channels are fully supported and rendering speed is near-optimal in many cases. Rendering is either done in software using DirectFB or in hardware using OpenGL. If OpenGL is used as backend, images and even videos can be scaled, rotated and warped without using the cpu. libavg supports a hierarchial layout model: A recursive set of invisble boxes can be placed on the screen that serve as containers for all other elements, cropping them and defining a local coordinate system.
       <p>
       Input can come from mouse or keyboard. Scripts can react to these inputs, and change most of the attributes - position, size, opacity, rotation angle... - of all the active media on the fly.
       <p>
       Since the scripting language is python, all other libraries that are accessible from python can be used in cooperation with libavg. Things like sound, interfaces to custom input devices, listening to network traffic etc. aren't implemented in libavg because there are existing python libraries that take care of this.
       <p>
       Oh, and the C++ code that implements all this looks readable and is very open for expansion. 
       <p><b>Ain't Vector Graphics?!</b>
       <p>
       Some presumably pretty smart people defined the svg (Scalable Vector Graphics - <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/</a>) file format that is used as a portable way to describe two-dimensional graphics. The avg file format is loosely based on svg, but with a focus on pixel- rather than vector-oriented graphics. 
       <p>
       Hence the name.
