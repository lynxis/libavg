       These are my current ideas on what to do with libavg. To make this thing fly and set prioritites, I'm depending on lots of input: u.zadow at gmx.de.
       <p><b>Short- to Medium-term</b>
       <ul>
       <li>Support for PowerPC linux: Thanks to the ingenious Mr. Bogk, we have about 20 PowerPCs sitting in the c-base. libavg compiles on these machines, but colors are completely out of whak because somewhere between libavg, DirectFB, the framebuffer device, the pci bus and the processor, bytes that shouldn't be are swapped around. We're working on it.
       <li>Touchscreen support: We've got half a dozen MicroTouch touchscreens laying around in the c-base and we'd like to use them.</li>
       <li>Support for hardware acceleration: Currently, all rendering is done in software. The software renderer is pretty well optimized, and this is ok for older systems, but for systems that support it, the graphic card's processing power stays unused. In the short term, at least hardware video overlays should be supported.</li>
       <li>Better font rendering quality: Something's wrong with the antialiasing on some fonts...</li>
       <li>Networking support: We'd like to have external systems tell an avg session what to do. The basic idea is that we'll open a port and just accept valid javascript strings that get executed in the context of the session. Getting two avg sessions on different computers to comunicate is the next step. Both shouldn't involve a lot of work.</li>
       <li>Sound: I've been given permission to take the cool multi-channel sound library sitting around at my employer <a href="http://www.artcom.de">Art+Com</a> and add it to libavg. Now I just have to find the time to do it.</li>
       </ul>
       <p><b>Long-term</b>
       <ul>
       <li>Stylesheets are nice in html. They'd be nice for avg, too.</li>
       <li>Memory management: Currently, all images are loaded on startup. That's good for small- to medium-sized projects, but some kind of caching/preload scheme would be nessesary for larger projects.</li>
       <li>Advanced text handling: This can go in two directions. The first is layout support, and the second is support for wild typo-nerd antics - rotated text, text as alpha channel of an image...</li>
       <li>Support for full javascript debugging.</li>
       <li>Support for 2d rendering using OpenGL: DirectFB is a good video subsystem, but using OpenGL would allow hardware acceleration on many more plattforms.</li>
       <li>Support for other operating systems. Due to the preferences of the typical artist/designer, Mac OS X is the primary candidate for porting. Of course, Windows might happen, too.</li>
       <li>Support for buttons, text fields and other gui elements. A lot of this can be hand-coded in javascript, but native support would be much better.</li>
       <li>Vector graphics support.</li>
       </ul>
